# Symptom Diagnoser

---

In this project I'm creating a simple machine learning model which gets disease symptoms as input and predicts the what disease it is.

I am using ensemble model in this project, it makes use of Navie Bayes, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier to predict the diseases.
